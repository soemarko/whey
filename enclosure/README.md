# Enclosure

## TTGO T-Display

I'm using it to simplify things. The STL is from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4843426 and I also use that exact LiPo battery.

## Plate

This is a tricky one. I haven't been able to remove wobbles when doing everything in plastic. So I got myself a cheapo, bottom of the barrel, 3018 CNC machine, and just slowly machine 2mm aluminium. The containing folders are the materials I used for my plate.

### Aluminium

Since it is a dinky little CNC machine, I'm not comfortable of machining a plate and wedge as a singular piece. So I just split it into two. Machine a couple of wedges (top and bottom), the smaller plate is the bottom one, which is just superglued onto the bottom case. The bigger plate is for the top one, just wedged in with top plastic and screwed together.

### Plastic

Everything should be obvious. The empty space towards the back is where my microcontroller sit. I just hotglue things to the case so they don't move around. And hotglue the wires so it won't push up against the top plate.

I just use 2 screws on the side to secure the ADS board because the battery I'm using is larger than expected. So part of the battery will just wedged under the other side of the ADS board.

### TPU

I added a TPU cover to protect against splashes. Looking back, I don't think I need to make a plastic top cover. Just machine a larger aluminium top plate and cover it with TPU. This is how I plan on making the 3kg plate.
